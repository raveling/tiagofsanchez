# Wrapping up

If have any suggestions around other different frameworks that I should be including here, please do let know. I will drop a [google form here](https://forms.gle/zDusbRKxRuLwJDdP7) to make life easier for anyone that would like to provide feedback. Thank you!

Remember, this is all about the process, putting the work at learning something new and to make sure you are able to retain as much as possible.

As part of the plan, I will be sharing progress on a daily basis [@party-corgi](https://www.partycorgi.com/). Alternatively, if you don't want to miss a thing just sign up for the 
[newsletter](https://tiagofsanchez.ck.page/c6b98eda74), I promise not to spam you and that you can ask me anything you want about my #100DayProject.

Hope to see you around!
