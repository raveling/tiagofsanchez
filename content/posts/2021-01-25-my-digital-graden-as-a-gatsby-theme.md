I have been building my digital garden over the past year and recently have been moving this under a gatsby-theme. In this case 2 gatsby-themes. 

- For my data I have -> [gatsby-theme-acmeblog-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-acmeblog-data)
- For my style I have -> [gatsby-theme-tfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-tfs)

And the content is all kept in my current [git repository](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/tiagofsanchez) while using Netlify as my CDN.  

This separation of concerns makes sense for me. When I am writing something I am doing it in `md` or `mdx`, I keep everything in one place with very limited code and styling considerations. In short I am trying to keep code distractions to the minimum only to consider them when I need to create richer components and render them in `mdx`.

- A dashboard with your writing stats


# üé® The options for your theme

There is a considerable amount of things for you to consider. Bellow you can check your options: 

| key      |  default value| 
|----------|-------------|
|`blogPath` |  `/blog` | 
|`postsContentPath` |    `content/posts`   |  
|`postsContentThumbnail` | `content/thumbnail` |   
|`pagesContentPath`| `content/pages`| 
|`otherImagesContentPath`| `content/images` | 
|`tagsPath`| `/tags`|
|`categoryPath`|`/category` |
|`postTableOfContents`|`false`|
|`gardenStartYear`| `2019`|
|` githubUrl` | ``|

Despite the fact of being a very opinionated theme, I am still trying to allow users to have a certain degree of flexibility. I would say there are three types of options: 

1. In the url options the user can select the urls, e.g. `blogPath`, `tagsPath` and `categoryPath` that will be programmatically generated;
2. The folder options the user will define how to organize the content, e.g. `postsContentPath`, `postsContentThumbnail`, `pagesContentPath` and `otherImagesContentPath` into folders that will be automatically generated;
3. We also have UI options where the user can choose to have a table of contents and the year where the user started his / her digital garden, e.g. `postTableOfContents` and `gardenStartYear`.

In `gatsby-config.js` you will be able to define the options that you want for your theme, however this options are not mandatory as I considered the default values that I am currently using. 

Having said that you could use the following.

```js
module.exports = { 
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-tfs",
      options: { 
        blogPath: "/anything", // the default will be /blog
        tagsPath: "/mytags", // the default will be /tags
        categoryPath: "/mycategory", // the default will be /category
        postsContentPath: "myblog/posts", // the default will be content/posts
        pagesContentPath: "myblog/pages", // the default will be content/pages
        otherImagesContentPath: "mysuperimages", // the default will be images
        githubUrl: "your repo url so that users can edit it",
        postTableOfContents: true //the default is false
        gardenStartYear: 2021 // the default will be 2019
      }
    },
  ],
};

```

# üöÄ Using gatsby-theme-tfs

If you were to start from an empty folder you will need to start with 2 things: 

- The `package.json` file 
- And the `gatsby-config.js` file

Ok, now you can open your code editor and create those 2 files. Let's start with the first one.

```json:title=package.json {8}
{
  "name": "tfs",
  "author": "Tiago Sanchez",
  "main": "index.mdx",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.31.1",
    "gatsby-theme-tfs": "^2.0.10",
    "react": "^16.4.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.4.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve"
  }
}
```

Please feel free to change the first properties of `json` file as you see fit. Now let's move to the `gatsby-config` file

```js:title=gatsby-config.js {22-29}
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    siteTitle: `tiagofsanchez`,
    siteTitleAlt: `Simple Blog - @tiagofsanchez/gatsby-theme-acmeblog`,
    siteHeadline: `Simple Blog - Gatsby Theme from tiagofsanchez`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.tiagofsanchez.com/`,
    siteDescription: ` Learning tech, writing about it and putting ‚úíÔ∏è'pen to paper' on stuff that I like to do and think about!`,
    siteLanguage: `en`,
    siteImage: `./images/logo.png`,
    author: `tiagofsanchez`,
    navigation: [
      {
        title: `Me`,
        slug: `/about`,
      },
      {
        title: `Articles`,
        slug: `/blog`,
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-tfs",
      options: {
        githubUrl: "https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/tiagofsanchez/blob/master/", 
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Despite the fact that I am only highlighting the plugin part it is important to note that, at the moment, and considering the way I have designed the navigation on this theme we will have to explicitly define those in `siteMetadata`. Also important to note that the respective slugs will need to be the same as the ones in the options of the plugin and / or the names of the pages that will be created on the folder structure.

After creating those files you can now just run `yarn` on your cli to install all your packages and dependencies and you should be ready to go. 

You now have 2 options; you can run `gatsby develop` to trigger the creation of the folder structure as per the options that we set up or we can manually create those folders. If we run the command we will see a couple of errors as none of the folders will have content in it and the graphql queries will not work properly. 

I am lazy so I will always run the command. That will result on the following folder structure: 

```
folderName
-content
    -images
    -pages
    -posts
    -thumbnails
```

Hope this is useful and do let me know if you need help.
