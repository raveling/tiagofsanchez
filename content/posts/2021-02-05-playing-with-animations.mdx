I always wanted to learn on how to play with **transitions** and **animations** and I have played with it a couple of times, but I never looked into the fundamentals. 

# Transitions

From a pure css perspective we need to be aware of a couple of things: 
- **`transition`** is the shorthand property used to represent the 4 transition-related properties
- **`transition-property`** to effectively target the property that will be "animated"
- **`transition-duration`** that will give the time of that transition
- **`transition-timing-function`** that will specify how intermediate states will be computed
- **`transition-delay`** that will define the time when the property is changed
