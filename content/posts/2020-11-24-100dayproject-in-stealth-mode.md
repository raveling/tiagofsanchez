I have been slacking. 

What started with the intention to be a #100DayProject 

# What is next? 

Definitely I need to continue to push more frameworks and drive more content that is relevant. There are so many that I want to publish and write about... it is just a question of time. If you have great ideas that you would like to share, please do it [here](https://forms.gle/zDusbRKxRuLwJDdP7). 

One of the ideas that I will be also exploring is: having slides for every framework in there. Basically anyone will be able download each framework slide as a PDF.

That is it for this week, just keeping it short. 

Hope to see you around!
