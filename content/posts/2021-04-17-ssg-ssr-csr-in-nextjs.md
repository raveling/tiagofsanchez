I have been working with Gatsby for a while (this digital garden is build whit it) and to some extend I knew the differences between Client Side Rendering and Static Site Generator, however I wanted to better understand those differences, from an implementation standpoint, as well as to better understand how to implement Server Side Render as a data fetching mechanism. 

This post is about exploring those different mechanisms using Nextjs framework.
