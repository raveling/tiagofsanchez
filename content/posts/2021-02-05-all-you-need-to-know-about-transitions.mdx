import { Box } from "theme-ui";

I always wanted to learn on how to play with **transitions** and **animations** and I have played with it a couple of times, but I never looked into the fundamentals.

# Transition properties

From a pure css perspective we need to be aware of a couple of things:

- **`transition`** is the shorthand property used to represent the 4 transition-related properties
- **`transition-property`** to effectively target the property that will be "animated"
- **`transition-duration`** that will give the time of that transition
- **`transition-timing-function`** that will specify how intermediate states will be computed
- **`transition-delay`** that will define the time when the property is changed

The way to think about this in CSS is actualy simple:

```css
.selector {
  transition: property duration transition-timing-function delay;
}
```

That means that we only need a line of CSS to define the desired behaviour.

# Transition example

Have a look at this example that we will be deconstructing

<Box sx={{ mt: 4 }}>
  <CodePen codePenId="RwoPKaN" />
</Box>

The good thing about embedding codePen here is that you can actualy see all the code
that is building this transition. However, let me break that down for you.

The first thing we did was to create the HTML document

```html
<h1>Playing with CSS transition</h1>

<h2>Parent and child example with transition</h2>
<div class="container">
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="child"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After that we have to give it basic styling so that we can start to play with the `transition` property.

```css
* {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: pink;
}

h1 {
  color: #d23669;
}

.container {
  margin: auto;
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
}

.parent {
  width: 250px;
  height: 250px;
  background-color: tomato;
  border: 6px solid blue;
}

.child {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Then we can think about how to move the blue square - child element - to the end of the red square - parent element. Effectively we want 
to transform the child element whenever the user hovers over the parent element. 


```css {28,31-33}
* {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: pink;
}

h1 {
  color: #d23669;
}

.container {
  margin: auto;
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
}

.parent {
  width: 250px;
  height: 250px;
  background-color: tomato;
  border: 6px solid blue;
}

.child {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: blue;
  transition: transform 1s ease-out,
}

.parent:hover .child {
  transform: translateX(100%);
}
```

The expected behaviour is a little bit more complex thought and we also want to have 


# Properties transition can target

# The timing function property

This was very helpful for me to better understand the basics of transition property in CSS.

Hope this also can be helpful to you.
