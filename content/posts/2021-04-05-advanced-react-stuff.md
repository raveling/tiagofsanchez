For the last couple of months I have been trying to learn a bit more about react, graphQl and different headless CMS solutions (keystoneJS) by going through [wesbos advance react course](https://advancedreact.com/). 

Here you will find a couple of my things that I have learnt, some thoughts about this learning approach and what I will do next on the back of all this. 

Please bear in mind that this is more of a list of things that I have learnt along the way and it is design in a selfish attempt to retain the key things that I consider important from this tutorial.

# Learnings

It will be hard to capture all the things that I am have learnt through this course as there are many things, anyhow this is my attempt: 

## Overall react stuff

- **Styled components**: I have to admit I have been using it poorly, so I am very glad to learn that I can style child html tags within a specific style component. Also I never user IntelliSense for Styled components, now I can't live without [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components);
- **GlobalStyles**: Whenever using Styled Components it is possible to have Global Style component that will take care of the global styles for us as long as we create a HOC that injects those stylings;
- **Javascript nesting chaining**: Love it!
- **Intel.NumberFormat API**: Excellent API to format numbers for you without needing to instal a library, [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat)
- **Custom React Hooks**: defining functions that clean state of the form in the hook itself. A good example [here](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/learning-advanced-react/blob/main/sick-fits/frontend/hooks/useFormInput.js)
- **fieldset tag and aria-labels property**: Use a combination of fieldset tab, aria-labels and css to properly style a form. A good example of that can be see [here](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/learning-advanced-react/blob/main/sick-fits/frontend/components/CreateProduct.js) 

## Nextjs:

- **Server Side Rendering**: Having worked with create-react-add and Gatsby I knew the differences between Client Side Rendering and Static Site Generator, however,

# Thoughts about this approach

Learning something new is a very hard thing to do, it takes time, dedication and effort. There are several different ways to learn how to code; **(1)** you could try to learn the theory first or **(2)** jump into code along type of tutorials or even **(3)** build a project of your own. (please note that this is an exhaustive list of ways to learning how to code, but rather a simple list of things that I tried to do my self)

There is not right or wrong and to be honest I love all approaches, however I do believe that it is through endless repetition that we really learn. Personally, from time to time I go through a couple of tutorials that tackle topics that I like to learn more about and that works very well for me - as psychologist [Lev Vygotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky) defends "we become ourselves through others". 

I reckon this approach works very well for me but I also feel that it is super important to combine that type of learning with

Or, trying to fight imposter syndrome :)
